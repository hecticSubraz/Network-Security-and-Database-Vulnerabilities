# 30 days of Network security and Database vulnerabilities
I will be learning Network security and Database vulnerabilities for 30 days and I will be updating daily about my progress and understanding.

# Day 1 of #Network security and Database vulnerabilities 
## Introduction to TCP/IP 
 Today I learned  about TCP/IP protocal as well as model, how was it  developed and its different layers used in network communication communication.
 
### TCP/IP
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet).

### History of TCP/IP
* TCP/IP protocol suite, was designed in 1970s by 2 DARPA scientists—Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn.
 * In 1973, they started researching  on reliable data communications across packet radio networks, factored in lessons learned from the Networking Control Protocol, and then created the next generation Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the standard protocol used on the Internet today.
* The early versions of this technology was only one core protocol, which was named TCP. 
* The first version of this predecessor of modern TCP was written in 1973, then revised and formally documented in RFC 675, Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program from December 1974.

### TCP/IP model and its layers
There are four layers of the TCP/IP model: network access, internet, transport, and application. Used together, these layers are a suite of protocols. The TCP/IP model passes data through these layers in a particular order when a user sends information, and then again in reverse order when the data is received.

#### Network Access layer(Layer 1):
* It is a group of applications requiring network communications
* Responsible for generating the data and requesting connections
* Acts on behalf of the sender and the Network Access layer on the behalf of the receiver 
* TCP/IP is identified by the this layer
* Error prevention and “framing” are also provided by this  layer
#### Internet layer(Layer 3):
* parallels the functions of OSI’s Network layer
* defines the protocols which are responsible for the logical transmission of data over the entire network
* protocals such as IP,ICMP and ARP lies in this layer
#### Transport layer(Layer 4):
* exchange data receipt acknowledgments and retransmit missing packets to ensure that packets arrive in order and without error  
* protocals such as TCP and UDP are used in this layer
#### Application layer( Layer 5):
* responsible for end-to-end communication and error-free delivery of data
* shields the upper-layer applications from the complexities of data
